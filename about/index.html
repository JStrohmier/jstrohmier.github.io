<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>Have you ever been unable to access a website that you were trying to reach? People with disabilities face issues like this regularly and this is what I want to change.</p>
  <p>Of course, not everyone is going to have issues, but have you ever read video subtitles because it was too loud around you? Those captions could be the difference between a good or bad experience for anyone accessing your website.</p>
  <p>I want to ensure a positive experience for your website users and prevent the cost associated with negative experiences.</p>
  <p>With my degree in technology development and deployment, as well as my background in quantitative and qualitative research, I analyze issues that exist in websites and I improve them using my web development skills. I want to maximize the potential for online content to be used universally.</p>
  <p>I believe improving web access for everyone is the best way to connect your message to the world.</p>
  <p>My name is Jean Strohmier and I can design your website to be a positive experience for not only your target audience, but your potential audience. </p>
