<div class="blurb">
	<h1>I Wear Many Hats</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Jean (Lee) Strohmier. With my Master of Information Management degree and a background in psychology, I am especially interested in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Overcoming barriers to access and usability of Internet resources.</li>
		<li>The development of community spaces.</li>
		<li>The advancement of literacy initiatives through technology.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've worked in research and writing copy in response to grant proposals, RFIs, an RFP, and other awards. Before that, I worked as a retail sales associate and ESOL tutor. I'm pretty good at:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proposals = Reading the fine print and checking documents for issues.</li>
		<li>Research = Digging into data and pulling out targeted information.</li>
		<li>Sales = Interviewing clients about their preferences and striving for an experience that attracts and motivates clients to come back.</li>
		<li>Tutor = Sharing skills, tracking progress, and motivating growth.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As a curator of information, here's the scoop on what I bring to the table outside of my work credentials. (Thanks to Internet tutorials!):</p>
	<ul>

		<li>I will hook you up with the fluffiest cloud of a vanilla cupcake. I baked and decorated my best friend's wedding cake LIKE A BOSS.</li>
		<li>I DIY-ed my way through my own budget wedding (with assistance). This includes designing wedding invitations, centerpieces, place cards, dip-dyeing napkins, and planning a family-catered menu. Given the opportunity to do it again, I'd elope. That said, each project on its own was fun and the food was amazing.</li>
		<li>Planning a pig roast anniversary party for someone else is a piece of cake after coordinating my own wedding.</li>
		<li>A teacup set had sold out on <a href="https://www.modcloth.com/">ModCloth.com</a>. I located the same set at a coffee shop in Indiana for someone in Maryland.</li>
		<li>I can play an ukulele. Not very well. Source: <a href="https://youtu.be/A0mJxQbXWAc">Youtube - Your first ukulele lesson - "Three Little Birds"</a>.</li>
		<li>I love <a href="https://baltimore.craigslist.org/search/zip">free stuff on Baltimore Craigslist</a> and my reading room cost me $50.</li>
		<li>I will let you in on where to find the best donuts in Maryland. Source: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/">Yelp.com</a></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Access First</h2>
	<p>Having access to information online is important for everyone. Up until fairly recently, organizations have approached web accessibility as a costly remediation effort when facing a discrimination lawsuit.</p>
	<p>I want to help shift this focus from remediation to proactively being responsible and sustainable.</p>
