Have you ever been unable to access a website that you were trying to reach? People with disabilities face issues like this regularly and this is what I want to change. Of course, not everyone is going to have issues, but have you ever read video subtitles because it was too loud around you? Those captions could be the difference between a good or bad experience for anyone accessing your website. I want to ensure a positive experience for your website users and prevent the cost associated with negative experiences. With my degree in technology development and deployment, as well as my background in quantitative and qualitative research, I analyze issues that exist in websites and I improve them using my web development skills. Working with a technology development company, I created a prototype that maximized their website's potential for universal use. I believe improving web access for everyone is the best way to connect your organizationâ€™s message to the world. My name is Jean Strohmier and I can design your website to be a positive experience for not only your target audience, but your potential audience.
