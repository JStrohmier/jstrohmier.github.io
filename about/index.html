<div class="blurb">
	<h1>I Wear Many Hats</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Jean (Lee) Strohmier. With my Master of Information Management degree and a background in psychology, I am especially interested in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Overcoming barriers to access and usability of Internet resources.</li>
		<li>The development of community spaces.</li>
		<li>The advancement of literacy initiatives through technology.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I've worked in research and writing copy in response to grant proposals, RFIs, an RFP, and other awards. Before that, I worked as a retail sales associate and ESOL tutor. I'm pretty good at:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proposals = Reading the fine print and checking documents for issues.</li>
		<li>Research = Digging into data and pulling out targeted information.</li>
		<li>Sales = Interviewing clients about their preferences and striving for an experience that attracts and motivates clients to come back.</li>
		<li>Tutor = Sharing skills, tracking progress, and motivating growth.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Curating information that was available online, I was able to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Bake and decorate my best friend's wedding cake.</li>
		<li>DIY my own budget wedding (with help from family and friends, of course): Designed wedding invitations, dyed napkins, made centerpieces, made place cards, planned the family-catered menu...</li>
		<li>Plan a pig roast anniversary party for 50+ people.</li>
		<li>Locate a teacup set from a coffee shop in Indiana for someone in Maryland.</li>
		<li>Learn to play my ukulele.</li>
		<li>Decorate a reading room for less than $50. Hellooo <a href="https://baltimore.craigslist.org/search/zip">free stuff on Baltimore Craigslist</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having access to information online is important for everyone. Up until fairly recently, organizations have approached web accessibility as a costly remediation effort when facing a discrimination lawsuit.</p>
	<p>I want to help shift this focus from remediation to proactively being responsible and sustainable.</p>
	<p>This website is under construction. I'm learning new things about web access and universal use every day.</p>
