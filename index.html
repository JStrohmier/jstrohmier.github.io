	<h1>Jean Wears Many Hats</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm Jean (Lee) Strohmier. I've worked in research and writing copy in response to grant proposals and government solicitations. Curating information that was available online, here are some accomplishments that I am particularly proud of:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Baked and decorated my best friend's wedding cake.</li>
		<li>DIY-ed my own budget wedding (with help from family and friends, of course): Designed wedding invitations, dyed napkins, made centerpieces, made place cards, planned the family-catered menu...</li>
		<li>Planned a pig roast anniversary party for 50+ people.</li>
		<li>Located a teacup set from a coffee shop in Indiana for someone in Maryland.</li>
		<li>Learned to play my ukulele.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Having access to information online is important for everyone. Up until fairly recently, organizations have approached web accessibility as a costly remediation effort when facing a discrimination lawsuit.</p>
	<p>I want to help shift this focus from remediation to proactively being responsible and sustainable.</p>
	<p>Master of information management with a background in psychology, I am especially interested in overcoming barriers to access and usability of Internet resources, the development of community spaces, and the advancement of literacy initiatives through technology.</p>
	<p>This website is constantly under construction. I'm learning new things about web access and universal use every day.</p>
